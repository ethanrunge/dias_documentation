    "We are interested in seeing how well the rotation solution actually works.\n",
    "There are a couple of tests that can be done to see how well we are correcting for or tracking the actual motion of the instrument.\n",
    "It is expected that the instrument suspension system is quite robust, so we need to see if the rotation solution is working properly, or if there are issues with the suspension.\n",

    "This work will take three major approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check theta, the angle between the X and Y components of the rotated solution and see how it changes in time\n",
    "2. Plot the total magnetic field and each of the components in the frequency domain\n",
    "3. Take the ROS/Gazebo simulation data, create \"fake\" areas of differing magnetic fields, and modify the magnetic data as though it had flown through those areas. See what happens to the solution in this scenario"
